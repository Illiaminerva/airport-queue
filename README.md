# Airport Security Queue Simulator

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based simulation of airport security queue systems. It was developed to explore the impact of various configurations on queue efficiency and traveler wait times, aiming to find the optimal number of security queues for airports.

## Background
Managing airport security effectively is crucial for minimizing traveler delays while maintaining high security standards. This simulator allows users to model different scenarios to see how the number of queues affects overall system performance.

## Features
- **Simulation of Traveler Arrivals:** Travelers arrive at security according to a Poisson distribution.
- **Security Check Modeling:** Service times follow a Truncated Normal Distribution.
- **Impact of Additional Screenings:** Includes the probability of additional screenings and their effect on queues.

## Objectives
- Evaluate how the number of security queues influences traveler wait times and system throughput.
- Determine the optimal queue configuration for minimizing wait times without sacrificing security procedures.
- Compare theoretical predictions with simulated outcomes to validate models.

## How to Use
The repository contains the Python scripts necessary for running the simulations. Users can modify the simulation parameters to test different queue configurations and study their impacts on system efficiency.

## Key Results
Simulation results provided insights into:
- The relationship between queue numbers and wait times.
- Effects of additional screening processes on overall efficiency.
- Recommendations for airport queue configurations to optimize flow and security.
